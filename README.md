# Numi Launchbar

Launchbar action for awesome little calculator [Numi](https://numi.io/)

## Installation

To get the most recent version, clone the repository and cp .lbaction bundle
into action folder of Launchbar: 
'''bash git clone
https://github.com/Rahlir/NumiLaunchbar.git 
cp -r NumiLaunchbar/Numi\ Calculate.lbaction ~/Library/Application\ Support/LaunchBar/Actions/ 
'''
Or, download the bundle _here_ and double click on the bundle to install
automatically. (currently no download link)


## Caveat 

Right now, the action is unsigned. This means that you either have to sign it
yourself or allow unsigned actions in Launchbar's index.
